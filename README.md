# home-assistant-mushroom-conditional-card
Some lovelace yaml to create some conditional cards using mushroom - see https://community.home-assistant.io/t/mushroom-cards-build-a-beautiful-dashboard-easily

The conditional cards onlu display the chip is the condition is met. For persons, it means they are home. For appliances, it only displays the chip when 
the appliance in use.

Screenshot 1 - I've removed the condition to just to display all the chips
