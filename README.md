# home-assistant-mushroom-conditional-card
Some lovelace yaml to create some conditional cards using mushroom - see https://community.home-assistant.io/t/mushroom-cards-build-a-beautiful-dashboard-easily

The conditional cards only display the chip is the condition is met. For persons, it means they are home. For appliances, it only displays the chip when 
the appliance in use. There are no actions assigned to pressing the chips yet.

The third row is not conditional (yet. I'd like to only display the rubbish collection the day before and I'd like to only display ORCL when it is up :lol: )

Screenshot 1 - I've removed the condition to just to display all the chips

Screenshot 2 - More normal operation with most chips not visible.
